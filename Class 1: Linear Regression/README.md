This is the first class on Machine Learning. The files in this folder include the regular ipython notebook and the Notes.

However, in addition to that we have some materials for the lecture (Class 1 Visuals, Loss Function Demo). Likewise, we have an optional calculus-based gradient descent worksheet. Finally, we have a file providing descriptions about the wine data that we use.
