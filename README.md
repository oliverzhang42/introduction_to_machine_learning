Hello! This is an Introductory course for Machine Learning aimed at high school students or anyone without a calculus background. 

The course is divided up into three classes. These classes are: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.

Within each class folder, there is a set of notes as well as an ipython notebook. The notes will give you the theoretical background required, and the ipython notebook should give you examples (and practice) on how to implement the Machine Learning algorithms.
